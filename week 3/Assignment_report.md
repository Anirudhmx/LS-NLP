# IMDb Sentiment Classification with BERT — Explanation

## Importing Libraries

First, we import all the required libraries: Hugging Face’s `transformers` for model and training utilities, `datasets` for loading IMDb data, `evaluate` for metrics, and standard packages like NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and torch. These provide everything needed for tokenization, model fine-tuning, evaluation, and visualization.

## Loading the Dataset

The IMDb movie review dataset is loaded using `load_dataset("imdb")`. We wrap this in a `try/except` block to catch issues like network errors or corrupted cache files. This dataset has train and test splits with positive and negative movie reviews.

## Initializing the Model and Tokenizer

We initialize the BERT tokenizer and model from `google-bert/bert-base-uncased`, a powerful pretrained English-language model. The tokenizer turns raw text into numerical tokens, while the model will be fine-tuned for binary classification (positive/negative). Errors during this step, like invalid model names or download issues, are caught for robustness.

## Tokenization Function

We define a `tokenize()` function to prepare text inputs for BERT by adding padding and truncating long sequences. It checks for the presence of the `"text"` key to avoid silent failures on bad inputs.

## Evaluation Metrics

We load four metrics using Hugging Face’s `evaluate`: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our `compute_metrics()` function processes model predictions, calculates these metrics, and handles any errors during computation (e.g., mismatched predictions and labels).

## Training Loop

The script runs a loop for two fine-tuning iterations. Each time, it:
1. Randomly shuffles the dataset with a different seed,
2. Selects 10,000 examples each from train and test splits,
3. Tokenizes the data,
4. Defines `TrainingArguments` with parameters like learning rate and evaluation strategy,
5. Initializes a `Trainer` with the model, datasets, and metrics,
6. Trains the model and evaluates it, storing metrics for later analysis.

The loop’s `try/except` ensures that errors during training or evaluation are caught, preventing the entire script from crashing.

## Saving the Model

After training, the fine-tuned model is saved locally with `model.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")`, so it can be reused for predictions later.

## Plotting and Exporting Metrics

Collected metrics from each run are stored in a pandas DataFrame, plotted to show accuracy and loss trends, and saved as a CSV file. This makes it easy to analyze how the model’s performance changes across runs.

## Inference on a Sample Text

Finally, the script tests the saved model on a sample sentence, tokenizes it, runs it through the model, and prints the predicted sentiment class. This demonstrates how to use the fine-tuned model for real predictions.

## Potential Issues

The script may run into problems such as:
- Memory errors on limited hardware,
- Network issues when downloading models or datasets,
- Dataset keys missing expected fields (breaking tokenization),
- Or unexpected runtime errors during training.

These are mitigated with targeted error handling throughout the script.
